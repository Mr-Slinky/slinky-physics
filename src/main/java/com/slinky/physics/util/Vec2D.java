/**
 * Represents a two-dimensional vector component within the ECS (Entity
 * Component System) design pattern used in the JellySmash game. This class
 * encapsulates the x and y coordinates of a vector, providing basic
 * functionalities to get and set these values.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is primarily used to represent positional data or movement vectors
 * in the physics calculations of JellySmash. By implementing the
 * {@code Component} interface, it integrates seamlessly into the ECS framework,
 * allowing for flexible manipulation and combination with other components.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code Vec2D} class offers methods that directly manipulate the
 * vector's data, allowing operations such as addition, subtraction, scaling,
 * and division to be performed on vectors in an intuitive and concise manner.
 * These methods return the instance of the vector they operate on, enabling
 * method chaining and thus more readable code.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * </p>
 * <pre><code>
 *     // Create a new Vec2D instance
 *     Vec2D v1 = Vec2D.of(10, 10);
 *     Vec2D v2 = Vec2D.of(20, 20);
 *
 *     // Chain multiple operations: mult, add, and normalise the vector
 *     v1.mult(2)       // floats the x and y components of v1 (20, 20)
 *       .add(v2)       // Adds the x and y components of v2 to v1 (40, 40)
 *       .normalize();  // (0.71, 0.71)
 *
 *     // The resulting vector 'velocity' will be scaled, adjusted, and normalised in sequence
 *     System.out.println(velocity);  // Output: Vector{x, y} (based on the operations)
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this example, the vector's x and y components are first scaled, then
 * adjusted by adding another vector, and finally normalised to unit length, all
 * in one fluent chain of method calls. This improves code readability and
 * maintains a clear and concise style.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For most non-static operation provided by this class, there is a static
 * counterpart that returns a new {@code Vec2D} instance instead of mutating
 * the existing vector. This allows for flexibility in vector operations, where
 * developers can choose between modifying the current vector or generating a
 * new vector based on the operation. The non-static methods are designed for
 * in-place updates, while the static methods facilitate operations that require
 * a fresh vector, making the class versatile for different use cases.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Example Usage:</b>
 * <pre><code>
 *     // Non-static add operation (in-place)
 *     Vec2D v1 = Vec2D.of(2, 3);
 *     Vec2D v2 = Vec2D.of(4, 5);
 *     v1.add(v2); // v1 is now (6, 8)
 *
 *     // Static add operation (new vector)
 *     Vec2D v3 = Vec2D.add(v1, v2); // v3 is (10, 13), v1 remains (6, 8)
 * </code></pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code Vec2D} class provides constructors for initialising vectors and
 * methods for modifying and retrieving the x and y coordinates. This class is
 * designed to be extendable and reusable across different systems that require
 * two-dimensional vector data, making it a core part of the physics engine.

     * An inner class representing an immutable unit vector. The

     * all setter methods and certain operations that would alter its state,
     * ensuring that the vector remains constant and immutable throughout its
     * lifecycle.
     *
     * <p>
     * The {@code UnitVectorConstant} is specifically designed to represent
     * immutable direction vectors, such as {@link Vec2D#LEFT}, {@link Vec2D#RIGHT},
     * {@link Vec2D#UP}, and {@link Vec2D#DOWN}. These vectors are
     * typically used to represent fixed directions in 2D space and should not
     * be modified after creation.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Similar to the {@link ZeroVector} class, the {@code UnitVectorConstant}
     * ensures that any attempt to alter the x or y coordinates, magnitude, or
     * orientation of the vector will result in an
     * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}. However, unlike
     * {@code ZeroVector}, the immutable nature of {@code UnitVectorConstant}
     * still allows for non-mutating operations that return new vectors based on
     * the original.
     * </p>
     *
     * <h3>Example Usage</h3>
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     * Vec2D leftVector = Vec2D.LEFT;
     *
     * // Attempting to modify leftVector will result in an exception:
     * leftVector.setX(0); // Throws UnsupportedOperationException
     * leftVector.setY(1); // Throws UnsupportedOperationException
     *
     * // Safe operations that return a new vector:
     * Vec2D resultVector = leftVector.add(new Vec2D(1, 0)); // Returns a new vector
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>
     * This design ensures that direction vectors, once created, remain
     * unchanged and can be relied upon for consistent behavior throughout an
     * application. Mutable operations like addition, subtraction, and scaling
     * are allowed, but they return new {@code Vec2D} instances rather than
     * altering the original vector.
